== About
CodeRay is a Ruby library for syntax highlighting.

Syntax highlighting means: You put your code in, and you get it back colored;
Keywords, Strings, Floats, Comments - all in different colors.
And with line numbers.

*Syntax* *Highlighting*...
* makes code easier to read
* lets you detect errors faster
* helps you to understand the syntax of a language
* looks nice
* is what everybody should have on their website
* solves all your problems and makes the girls run after you
