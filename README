== About
CodeRay is a Ruby library for syntax highlighting.

Syntax highlighting means: You put your code in, and you get it back colored;
Keywords, strings, floats, comments - all in different colors.
And with line numbers.

*Syntax* *Highlighting*...
* makes code easier to read
* lets you detect errors faster
* helps you to understand the syntax of a language
* looks nice
* is what everybody should have on their website
* solves all your problems and makes the girls run after you

== Credits

=== Special Thanks to

* licenser (Heinz N. Gies) for ending my QBasic career, inventing the Coder project and the input/output plugin system.
  CodeRay would not exist without him.

=== Thanks to

* Caleb Clausen for writing RubyLexer (see http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubylexer) and lots
  of very interesting mails traffic
* Jamis Buck for writing Syntax (see http://rubyforge.org/projects/syntax)
  I got some useful ideas from it.
* Doug Kearns and everyone else who worked on ruby.vim - it not only helped me coding CodeRay,
  but also gave me a wonderful target to reach for the Ruby scanner.
* everyone who used CodeRay on http://www.rubyforen.de and http://www.infhu.de/mx
* iGEL, magichisoka, manveru and everyone I forgot from rubyforen.de
* Dookie (who is no longer with us...) and Leonidas from http://www.python-forum.de
* matz, nobu, why, dave, dhh, etc... you know, those Ruby gods and gurus
* The inventors of: the computer, the internet, the true color display, HTML & CSS, VIM, RUBY,
  pizza, microwaves, guitars, scouting, programming, anime, manga, coke and green ice tea.

Where would we be without all those people?

* As you can see, CodeRay was created under heavy use of *free* software.
* So CodeRay is also *free*.
* If you use CodeRay to create software, think about making this software *free*, too.
* Thanks :)
